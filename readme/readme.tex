The replication file includes codes and helper files to replicate the Monte Carlo simulations for Maximal Clique and HF method. The codes can be decomposed to three steps; data generating, analyzing and evaluating. Outputs of the first two steps are saved to disk and the last step are tables of evaluation results. The replication file also contains the codes for application, both for MCL and HF.

The codes are designed in R project version >3.4 and Gauss 6 for Windows and run in Windows 10 64 bit OS. To run the code trouble-free, the following requirements must be satisfied.
\begin{flushleft}
	\large Requirements
\end{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
\item R project, Gauss 6.0 for Windows (or newer),
\item Following packages for R: "igraph", "urca", "stringr", "rugarch",
\item Gauss should be installed in directory C:/, not any subdirectory of C:/ (since the code calls Gauss from C:/gauss6.0/tgauss)

\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
	\large Usage
\end{flushleft}
Run all commands in main.R. The file contains commands for data generating, analyzing and evaluating for both method and each data type. The results are saved in Results folder as csv files. NOTE: The tables in these files are re-formed for the paper.
